- **Retrieve AQI Readings.ipynb.ipynb**: Notebook that pulls AQI data from the EPA AQS API for Tallahassee.
- **Fire Smoke Model.ipynb.ipynb**: Notebook that develops a predictive model for estimating future wildfire smoke impacts for Tallahassee (for the years 2025-2050).
- **Data Visualizations.ipynb**: Notebook containing visualizations related to the wildfire analysis, including time series graphs and histograms of fire data.
the Subset Wildfire data and Retrieve AQI readings were completed before the Fire Smoke Model and Data Visualization notebooks



### Files Produced by `Retrieve AQI Readings` Notebook

1. **subset_aqi_data.csv**
   - **Description**: A refined subset of `all_aqi_data.csv` that focuses on specific AQI values within a target date range or geographical area.
   - **Columns**:
     - `year`: Year of the AQI measurement.
     - `date_local`: The local date of the AQI measurement.
     - `site_number`: Monitoring site identifier.
     - `latitude`, `longitude`: Location of the monitoring site.
     - `aqi`: The AQI value for the measurement.


## Methodology

The analysis follows several key steps:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Load the Combined Wildland Fire dataset and the EPA AQS air quality data.
2. **Data Processing**: Filter the dataset to include only fires within 650 miles of Tallahassee. Calculate geodetic distances and determine the annual smoke impact estimates.
3. **Smoke Impact Estimation**: Estimate the annual wildfire smoke impact for each year from 1961 to 2021. The estimate considers factors such as fire size and proximity to the city.
4. **AQI Comparison**: Compare the wildfire smoke estimates to the EPA AQI data for Tallahassee to assess the accuracy of our estimates.
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop a predictive model to estimate wildfire smoke impacts for the next 25 years (2025-2050).
6. **Visualization**: Create time series graphs and histograms to visualize the findings of the analysis.
