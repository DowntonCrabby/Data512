    "# Wildfire Data Preparation and Subsetting for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subsetting Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The following criteria are applied to the data to narrow the scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Temporal Range**: The data is limited to the last 60 years, specifically between **1961 and 2021**. This timeframe provides a more recent view of wildfire activity and is more relevant for studying modern fire trends.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Proximity to Assigned City**: Only fires occurring within **650 miles of the assigned city (Tallahassee, Fl)** are included. This spatial filter allows us to focus on fires that have a direct geographical impact on the region of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Seasonal Filter**: The annual wildfire season is defined as running from **May 1st through October 31st**. Fires within this period are more likely to be impactful in terms of seasonal trends, resource allocation, and environmental effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete [Wildfire dataset](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61aa537dd34eb622f699df81) can be retrieved from a US government repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has dependencies on [Pyproj](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/index.html), the [geojson](https://pypi.org/project/geojson/) module, and the wildfire user module. Pyproj and geojson can be installed via pip.\n",
