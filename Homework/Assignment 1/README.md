# README: Rare Disease Wikipedia Pageviews Data Collection and Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to collect, analyze, and document monthly pageviews for a set of rare disease-related articles from English Wikipedia. Using the Wikimedia REST API, the project retrieves pageview data for each article from July 2015 through the most recent complete month (September 2024). The pageview data is collected separately for desktop and mobile access (including both mobile web and mobile app views). 

This project follows best practices for open scientific research and reproducibility, documenting all steps for data acquisition, processing, and analysis. The resulting dataset is stored in JSON format, and the analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook, providing visualizations of the trends over time.

## License Information
This project adheres to the following license terms:

- **Data Source**: The pageview data is sourced from Wikipedia, via the Wikimedia REST API. All data collected from Wikipedia is subject to the Wikimedia Foundation's [Terms of Use](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use). The data is used in compliance with Wikimedia's terms, and no proprietary information is included.
  
- **Project Code License**: The code used to collect and process the data is provided under the MIT License (see the LICENSE file for more details).

## Data Collection
### Data Source
The data was collected using the [Wikimedia REST API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_REST_API). Specifically, the pageviews were retrieved via the [pageviews/per-article](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/Pageviews%20data) endpoint, which provides access to monthly pageview counts.

### Access Types
The data was retrieved separately for the following access types:
1. **Desktop**
2. **Mobile Web**
3. **Mobile App**

### API Request Structure
The API requests are made using the following structure:
Where:
- `{project}` is `en.wikipedia.org` (English Wikipedia)
- `{access}` can be `desktop`, `mobile-web`, or `mobile-app`
- `{agent}` is `user`
- `{article}` is the URL-encoded title of the Wikipedia article
- `{granularity}` is `monthly`
- `{start}` and `{end}` are the date ranges in the format `YYYYMMDD00`

## Generated Files
The following files are generated by the code:

### 1. Mobile Access Data
**File Name**: `rare-disease_monthly_mobile_<startYYYYMM>-<endYYYYMM>.json`  
**Description**: Contains monthly pageview data for all rare disease articles for mobile access (both mobile web and mobile app). The pageviews from mobile web and mobile app are combined into a single view count for each article and month.  
**Data Schema**:
```json
{
  "Article_Title": [
    {
      "timestamp": "YYYYMMDD00",
      "views": Integer
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
